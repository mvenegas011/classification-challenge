# classification-challenge

I work at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and have been tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. I've been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants me to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

I've created two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models I've created are a logistic regression model and a random forest model.

STEPS TAKEN:
> Split the data into training and testing sets.
> Scale the features.
> Create a logistic regression model.
> Create a random forest model.
> Evaluate the models.
